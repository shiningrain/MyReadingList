2.  👍 **High Accuracy and High Fidelity Extraction of Neural Networks (2020 USENIX)**
    [[Notes](./notes/jagielski2020high.md)]
    [[Paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20fall_jagielski_prepub.pdf)]
    ⭐⭐⭐⭐

    **Overview:** A comprehensive work on model extraction, and gives a very mathematical method to functionally copy the target model (more than 99% fidelity). The problem is that their method requires too many queries.
