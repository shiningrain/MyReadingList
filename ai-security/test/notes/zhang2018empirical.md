## An empirical study on TensorFlow program bugs

### motivation

1. Tensorflow has been widely used and any bugs in the framework will lead to catastrophic consequences.
2. Traditional testing does not work well in AI system.
3. There is no research on the DL defects or  the root cause of DL bugs.

### effect

1. • A dataset of TensorFlow bugs collected from StackOverow and GitHub. 
2. • A study of the symptoms and root causes of the bugs, which could assist future studies on TensorFlow application testing and debugging techniques. 
3. • A study of the new challenges in detecting and localizing the bugs and the current strategies to address them, which opens new problems for future research.



### Detail

To sum up, this is  a report for the Tensorflow bug in the open source community. They summary the symptoms and root causes of the bugs and analyze the challenges

THEY  EVEN DOESNT HAS A EXPERIMENT.

It is undeniable that their work does provide a lot of reference and help for the bug detection and localization in deep learning frameworks. However, this article is more meaningful to give us a concept: 

> Highly cited articles may still have no experiments  ...No experiment can really be cited many times if its content is sufficient.
