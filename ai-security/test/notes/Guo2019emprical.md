## DL deployment:

### Motivation
1. There is no study on how various mainstream frameworks and platforms influence both DL software development and deployment in practice
### Effect
1. Several DL framework bugs.
2. procatical guidelines and identfy chanllenges on this new area.
### Detail
1. Main content:
    1) muti-backend training accuracy difference and performance on adversarial samples.
    2) Performance of model migration on different services(PC to mobile). 
2. RQ: 
    1)Accuracy on different frameworks.
    2)Adversarial robustness of trained models.
    3)Performance after migration and quantization.
    4)Prediction accuracy after migration and quantization.
