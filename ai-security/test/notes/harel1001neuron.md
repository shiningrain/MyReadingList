# Neuron meaningful measure
## Motivation
1. NC is a new test criterion for DL system. Prior work found preliminary
evidence that NC is correlated with defect detection capability
## Effect
1. Their results invoke skepticism that increasing neuron coverage may not be a meaningful objective for generating tests for deep neural networks.
2. Increased NC may have negative effect (at least no positive effect) on the defect detection,naturalness input, output impartiality.
3. Warning for the misuse of NC criteria.
## Detail
1. Three criteria in generating test cases:1)defect detection, 2) naturalness of generated test input,3)output impartiality(on special tag).
