## White-box fairness testing

### Motivation
1. Discrimination in DNNs is often more ‘hidden’ than that of traditional decision-making software.
2. Existing instance generation works forcus on traditional ML but not DNN

### Effect
1.  Present an efficient and effective approach ADF for generating individual discriminatory instances of DNN based on gradient.
2. Implement and publish ADF as a self-contained toolkit2 on-line.
3. ADF is significantly more effective and efficient in generating individual discriminatory instances than state-of-the-art methods
