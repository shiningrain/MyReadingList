## Energy and Policy Considerations DL NLP

### Motivation
1. Trainig a state-of-the-art model need substantial computational resources
2. Thousands of retraining also cost a lot. Can compare with the air travel from NY to SY

### Effect
1. Describe the dollar cost and carbomn emissions of most popular models.
2. Propose advice about fair training and efficiency training.

### Details
1. Compute the cost Pt=Time\*P\*PUE. Also the CO2 emissions is 0.954Pt.
2. Analysis for 4 models:Transformer(979M),ELMo,BERT(110M),GPT-2(1542M).
3. NAS can cost millions of many in computation($942,973â€“$3,201,722).
4. Conclusion:
   1. Authors should report training time and sensitivity to hyperparameters.
   2. Academic researchers need equitable access to computation resources.
   3. Researchers should prioritize computationally efficient hardware and algorithms.
